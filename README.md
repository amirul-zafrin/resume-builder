# resume-builder

We are currently developing this project as a way to improve our skills in software development. This project uses:
1. FastAPI
2. GraphQL (Strawberry)
3. SQLite/Postgres
4. SQLAlchemy(ORM)
5. Celery
6. RabbitMQ
7. Redis Cache
8. Docker

The aim of this project is to make sure that each developer that involved in this project knows the process of developing a web app from scratch, and along the way, we will come up with a simple module on understanding the listed tech.
